#     Make sure the letters are strings.
#     Make sure the indexes are stored in a list and those lists are values.


# CHALLANGE 2

# 1. Create a program that prints a list of the items you can afford in the store with the money you have in your wallet.
#     Sort the list in alphabetical order.
#     Return “Nothing” if you can’t afford anything from the store.
#     Hint : make sure to convert the amount from dollars to numbers. Create a program that deletes the $ sign, and the comma (for thousands)
