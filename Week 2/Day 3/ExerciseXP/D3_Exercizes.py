# EXERCISE 1

# 1. Convert the two following lists, into dictionaries.
# Hint: Use the zip method
# keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
# values = [10, 20, 30]
# Expected output:
# {'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}


Keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
Values = [10, 20, 30]

dictionary = zip(Keys, Values)
dictionary = dict(dictionary)
print(dictionary)


# EXERCISE 2

# 1. A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age.
# if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
# if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.
# if they are over the age of 12, the ticket is $15.

# Given the following object:

# family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}


# How much does each family member have to pay ?

# 4. Print out the family’s total cost for the movies.

People = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}
Costs = 0
for value in People.values():
    
    if value > 12:
        Costs += 15
    elif value < 13 and value > 3:
        Costs += 10

print(Costs)


# EXERCISE 3
# Here is some information about a brand.
# name: Zara 
# creation_date: 1975 
# creator_name: Amancio Ortega Gaona 
# type_of_clothes: men, women, children, home 
# international_competitors: Gap, H&M, Benetton 
# number_stores: 7000 
# major_color: 
#     France: blue, 
#     Spain: red, 
#     US: pink, green

# 2. Create a dictionary called brand which value is the information from part one (turn the info into keys and values).
# The values type_of_clothes and international_competitors should be a list. The value of major_color should be a dictionary.
# 3. Change the number of stores to 2.
# 4. Print a sentence that explains who Zaras clients are.
# 5. Add a key called country_creation with a value of Spain.
# 6. Check if the key international_competitors is in the dictionary. If it is, add the store Desigual.
# 7. Delete the information about the date of creation.
# 8. Print the last international competitor.
# 9. Print the major clothes colors in the US.
# 10. Print the amount of key value pairs (ie. length of the dictionary).
# 11. Print the keys of the dictionary.
# 12. Create another dictionary called more_on_zara with the following details:

# EXERCISE 4

# Use this list :

# users = ["Mickey","Minnie","Donald","Ariel","Pluto"]
# Analyse these results :

# #1/

# >>> print(disney_users_A)
# {"Mickey": 0, "Minnie": 1, "Donald": 2, "Ariel": 3, "Pluto": 4}

# #2/

# >>> print(disney_users_B)
# {0: "Mickey",1: "Minnie", 2: "Donald", 3: "Ariel", 4: "Pluto"}

# #3/ 

# >>> print(disney_users_C)
# {"Ariel": 0, "Donald": 1, "Mickey": 2, "Minnie": 3, "Pluto": 4}


# Use a for loop to recreate the 1st result. Tip : don’t hardcode the numbers.
# Use a for loop to recreate the 2nd result. Tip : don’t hardcode the numbers.
# Use a method to recreate the 3rd result. Hint: The 3rd result is sorted alphabetically.
# Only recreate the 1st result for:
# The characters, which names contain the letter “i”.
# The characters, which names start with the letter “m” or “p”.
