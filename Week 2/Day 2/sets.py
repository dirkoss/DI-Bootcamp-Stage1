# Sets are like lists, but cannot be indexed. They are unordered and do not allow duplicates.
# Use sets when 
    # 1. All you need is a collection of unique elements.
    # 2. You don't care about the order of the elements.
    # 3. You don't need to access the elements by index.
    # 4. You don't need to access the elements by key.
    # 5. You don't need to access the elements by value.
